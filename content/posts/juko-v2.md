## Introduction to Juko

Juko started out as a "startup idea" after I graduated from college and was struggling to find work at the start of the pandemic (a.k.a. the pando). I use the quotes because I'm not sure I ever seriously believed this idea had the legs to become anything substantial. The reason I worked on the idea at all, aside from needing something to fill my time between interviews and rejections, was because I believed it was solving a problem for me: I couldn't be bothered to skip through songs while biking, but I still wanted to find new music while biking. So in the interest of making my life easier, or so I believed, I built a mobile app using React Native which would take a user's playlist and generate recommendations from it. Then playback, which would happen in the browser itself, would skip songs every 30 seconds by default. If the user interacted with the app to "Like" or "Favorite" the song, it would cancel the default skip allowing the user to listen to the song in its entirety. It was an over-engineered mess which was meant to solve an entirely made-up personal pain point, but it was mine.
