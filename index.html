a. Design: User Story + Figma
b. Building: Django, React, Docker, GHA
c. Deploying: GKE, Kubernetes, Kustomize Conclusion Appendix Introduction to Juko Juko started out as a &ldquo;startup idea&rdquo; after I graduated from college (Dec 2019) and was struggling to find work at the start of the pandemic (a.k.a. the pando). I use the quotes because I&rsquo;m not sure I ever seriously believed this idea had the legs to become anything substantial.&mldr;</div><a href=/posts/juko-v2/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/notebooks/covid-19-vaccinations/>Investigating Global COVID-19 Vaccinations</a></h1><time>Feb 23, 2021</time><br><div class=description>Introduction I&rsquo;m curious to see how vaccination rates compare between countries and within countries (specifically the United States, India, and Israel).
Israel is the country with the fastest vaccination rate, already surpassing 30% of the total population vaccinated. I&rsquo;m curious to see how this compares to the other local Arab states (I know the UAE is in second in terms of vaccination rate), and how vaccination rates among Palestinians compare, if that data is available.&mldr;</div><a href=/notebooks/covid-19-vaccinations/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/defining-music-services/>Defining Music Services: Artist-facing vs. Listener-facing</a></h1><time>Aug 18, 2020</time><br><div class=description>Introduction When people think of music services they often think of streaming services like Spotify, Apple Music, and the like. While these are the largest players in the music services industry, streaming is far from the only service provided in the music industry. Music services can largely be split into two categories: listener-facing and artist-facing services. Listener-facing services are those which are geared towards helping listeners find new music (music discovery), save and store music they like, and listen to music by streaming remotely (Spotify) or playing from local storage (iTunes).&mldr;</div><a href=/posts/defining-music-services/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/music-discovery/>Problems in the Music Industry: The Need for Better Recommenders and Improved Music Discovery</a></h1><time>Aug 6, 2020</time><br><div class=description>Introduction Since artist compensation is dependent on the number of streams an artist can generate and the barrier of entry into music, in terms of distribution, is much lower, the entire pool of music available for streaming has become oversaturated with subpar songs and, more generally, the amount of readily streamable music is increasing rapidly. Building improved music discovery services and recommendation systems would solve these issues.
Artist Compensation and Counting Streams Firstly, the current model for compensating artists (adopted by Spotify and Apple Music, the two largest music streaming service providers) is entirely dependent on the number of streams an artist can generate.&mldr;</div><a href=/posts/music-discovery/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/notebooks/fma_rec_and_genre_classification/>Genre Classification and Recommendations Using the FMA Dataset</a></h1><time>Jul 23, 2020</time><br><div class=description>Introduction Working with the FMA dataset which contains audio features and free music snippets on 100k+ tracks. This is in the interest of working towards my own MIR using deep learning to extract audio features from audio signals (probably using GTZAN). The data comes from the FMA dataset. Let&rsquo;s start by training a model to do feature extraction given an MFCC (derived from an audio signal). We can use the Echonest dataset which comes with audio features already extracted and use the FMA set with librosa to generate the MFCC.&mldr;</div><a href=/notebooks/fma_rec_and_genre_classification/>Read more ⟶</a></section><ul class=pagination><span class="page-item page-prev"></span><span class="page-item page-next"><a href=/page/2/ class=page-link aria-label=Next><span aria-hidden=true>Next →</span></a></span></ul></main><footer><hr><a class=soc href=https://github.com/teejas title=GitHub><i data-feather=github></i></a>|<a class=soc href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/tejas-siripurapu-7b7b81105/ title=LinkedIn><i data-feather=linkedin></i></a>|<a class=soc href=https://twitter.com/ojsimpsome/ title=Twitter><i data-feather=twitter></i></a>|<a class=soc href=https://www.instagram.com/tejas.siripurapu/ title=Instagram><i data-feather=instagram></i></a>|⚡️
